# Pytiaa
Classification and analogical algorithm animations in Python

3 datasets algorithms generators  
+ N Random points for each class
+ N Points for each class group by class on the graph
+ Points group by class, but points distribution is defined


4 Algorithms
+ K-means
+ Fadana
+ Lazy Analogical classification
+ ??? 

Parent directory of Pytiaa run 'python -m Pytiaa.Algorithms.Kmeans'
Else relative imports won't work
